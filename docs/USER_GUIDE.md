## Workflow Overview

```
1. Prepare data (CSV/Parquet)
2. Upload via Streamlit or run pipeline script
3. Backtest: evaluate candidate models
4. Review results: leaderboard, FVA, champion map
5. Forecast: generate production forecasts
6. Monitor: drift alerts, data quality, cost
```

## Model Selection

The platform includes 18 registered models across 6 families. Use this decision tree:

### Quick Reference

| Family | Models | Best For | Data Needs | Speed |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Naive** | `naive_seasonal` | Baseline benchmark | Any series length | Instant |
| **Statistical** | `auto_arima`, `auto_ets`, `auto_theta`, `mstl` | Stable demand with clear trend/seasonality | 52+ weeks (weekly) | Fast |
| **ML** | `lgbm_direct`, `xgboost_direct` | Complex patterns, external regressors | 52+ weeks + features | Fast |
| **Neural** | `nbeats`, `nhits`, `tft` | Large datasets, complex interactions | 100+ series, 100+ weeks | Slow |
| **Foundation** | `chronos`, `timegpt` | Cold start, limited history | Any (zero-shot) | Medium |
| **Intermittent** | `croston`, `croston_sba`, `tsb` | Sparse/lumpy demand | 10+ non-zero observations | Fast |

### Decision Tree

1. **Is demand intermittent (many zeros)?**
   - Yes -> Enable sparse detection (`sparse_detection: true`). The platform auto-routes sparse series to intermittent models.
   - No -> Continue.

2. **Do you have external features (promotions, holidays, price)?**
   - Yes -> Use ML models (`lgbm_direct`, `xgboost_direct`). They automatically pick up feature columns.
   - Statistical and naive models silently ignore external features.

3. **How much history do you have?**
   - < 52 weeks -> Foundation models (`chronos`), or `naive_seasonal` with cyclic fallback.
   - 52-104 weeks -> Statistical (`auto_ets`, `auto_arima`) or ML (`lgbm_direct`).
   - 104+ weeks -> All models viable. Use backtest to compare.

4. **How many series?**
   - < 100 -> Any model. Neural models may overfit.
   - 100-10,000 -> ML models shine. Run backtest with 3-4 candidates.
   - 10,000+ -> Enable `batch_size` and `n_workers` for parallelism.

### Recommended Starting Configuration

```yaml
forecast:
  forecasters: [naive_seasonal, auto_ets, lgbm_direct]
  sparse_detection: true
  intermittent_forecasters: [croston_sba, tsb]
```

This gives you a baseline (naive), a strong statistical model (ETS), and an ML model (LightGBM). The backtest will pick the best per your data.

---

## Running a Backtest

Backtesting evaluates models using walk-forward cross-validation: train on past data, forecast the next N weeks, measure accuracy, slide the window forward.

### Configuration

```yaml
backtest:
  n_folds: 3                    # number of CV folds
  val_weeks: 13                 # validation window (one quarter)
  gap_weeks: 0                  # gap between train and test (for delayed data)
  champion_granularity: lob     # pick one champion for the whole LOB
  primary_metric: wmape          # rank by Weighted MAPE
  selection_strategy: champion   # "champion" (single best) or "weighted_ensemble"
```

### Run

```bash
python forecasting-product/scripts/run_backtest.py \
  --config configs/platform_config.yaml --lob retail
```

### Champion Selection Strategies

- **`champion`** — Picks the single model with lowest WMAPE across all folds. Simple, interpretable.
- **`weighted_ensemble`** — Blends top models using inverse-WMAPE weights. Often 1-3% more accurate, but harder to explain.

### Granularity Options

| Granularity | What It Does | When to Use |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `lob` | One champion for all series in the LOB | Default — simple and reliable |
| `product_group` | Different champion per product group | When product categories have very different demand patterns |
| `series` | Different champion per series | Large datasets (1000+ series) where per-series tuning matters |

---

## Interpreting Backtest Results

### Metrics

| Metric | Formula | What It Means | Good Range |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **WMAPE** | sum(\|error\|) / sum(\|actual\|) | Overall accuracy weighted by volume | < 20% is good, < 10% is excellent |
| **Normalized Bias** | sum(error) / sum(\|actual\|) | Systematic over/under-forecast | -5% to +5% is acceptable |
| **MAE** | mean(\|error\|) | Average error in original units | Domain-dependent |
| **RMSE** | sqrt(mean(error²)) | Penalizes large errors more | Domain-dependent |

### Leaderboard

The leaderboard ranks models by the primary metric (WMAPE by default), aggregated across all folds and series.

```
Rank | Model          | WMAPE  | Bias   | MAE
-----|----------------|--------|--------|-----
1    | lgbm_direct    | 12.3%  | -1.2%  | 234
2    | auto_ets       | 14.1%  | +0.8%  | 267
3    | naive_seasonal | 18.7%  | +2.1%  | 312
```

### Forecast Value Added (FVA)

FVA measures how much accuracy each model layer contributes compared to the naive baseline.

**Layers:**

| Layer | Models | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| L1: Naive | `naive_seasonal` | Baseline — always computed |
| L2: Statistical | `auto_arima`, `auto_ets`, `croston`, etc. | Best statistical per series |
| L3: ML | `lgbm_direct`, `xgboost_direct` | Best ML per series |
| L4: Override | Planner-adjusted | If planner override exists |

**FVA Classification:**

| Classification | WMAPE Change | Meaning |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| `ADDS_VALUE` | > 2 percentage points improvement | Model is helping |
| `NEUTRAL` | Within ±2 pp | No meaningful difference |
| `DESTROYS_VALUE` | > 2 pp degradation | Model is hurting — consider removing |

**Reading the FVA cascade chart (Streamlit Backtest Results page):**
- Bars show WMAPE at each layer
- Green arrows = layers that add value
- Red arrows = layers that destroy value
- If L3 (ML) destroys value vs L2 (Statistical), the ML model isn't learning anything useful beyond what ETS/ARIMA already captures

---

## Generating Forecasts

After backtesting, generate production forecasts:

```bash
python forecasting-product/scripts/run_forecast.py \
  --config configs/platform_config.yaml \
  --lob retail \
  --champion lgbm_direct
```

### Output

- **Forecast Parquet** — Point forecasts and prediction intervals per series per period
- **Pipeline Manifest** — JSON provenance file tracking what data, config, and model produced the forecast

See [DATA_FORMAT.md](DATA_FORMAT.md) for complete output schemas.

---

## Hierarchical Forecasting

When you have a hierarchy (e.g., SKU -> Category -> Total), hierarchical reconciliation ensures forecasts sum correctly at every level.

### Setup

```yaml
hierarchies:
  - name: product
    levels: [total, category, sku]
    reconciliation:
      method: mint     # bottom_up | top_down | ols | wls | mint
```

Your dimension data must include the hierarchy columns (e.g., `category` for each `sku`).

### Reconciliation Methods

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| `bottom_up` | Leaf (SKU) forecasts are accurate; upper levels are just sums |
| `top_down` | Top-level forecast is accurate; disaggregate by historical proportions |
| `ols` | No prior knowledge about which level is most accurate |
| `wls` | Some levels have more data (weights by leaf count or residual variance) |
| `mint` | Best overall accuracy — uses covariance of forecast errors (recommended) |

---

## External Regressors

Add external features (promotions, holidays, price) to improve ML model accuracy.

### End-to-End Example

1. **Prepare features file** (see [DATA_FORMAT.md](DATA_FORMAT.md) for schema):

```csv
week,store_id,promotion_flag,holiday_flag,price_index
2024-01-07,1,1,0,1.05
...
```

2. **Configure:**

```yaml
forecast:
  external_regressors:
    enabled: true
    feature_columns: [promotion_flag, holiday_flag, price_index]
    future_features_path: data/future_features.parquet
    screen:
      enabled: true              # auto-drop low-quality features
      variance_threshold: 1.0e-6
      correlation_threshold: 0.95
```

3. **Run pipeline** — ML models (`lgbm_direct`, `xgboost_direct`) automatically use the features. Statistical models ignore them.

### Regressor Screening

When `screen.enabled: true`, the platform automatically drops:
- **Near-zero variance** features (threshold: 1e-6)
- **Highly correlated** feature pairs (threshold: 0.95, keeps first)
- **Low mutual information** features (optional, `mi_enabled: true`)

Dropped features are logged in the pipeline manifest.

## AI Features

Four Claude-powered endpoints provide AI-native analysis. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Natural Language Query (`POST /ai/explain`)

Ask questions about forecasts in plain English:

```json
{
  "lob": "retail",
  "series_id": "STORE_001",
  "question": "Why did sales drop last week?"
}
```

Returns an answer with supporting data, confidence level, and sources used.

### Anomaly Triage (`POST /ai/triage`)

Prioritizes drift alerts by business impact:

```json
{
  "lob": "retail",
  "severity_filter": "critical",
  "max_alerts": 50
}
```

Returns ranked alerts with impact scores, suggested actions, and an executive summary.

### Config Recommendation (`POST /ai/recommend-config`)

Analyzes backtest results and recommends config changes:

```json
{ "lob": "retail" }
```

Returns specific recommendations (e.g., "switch from `naive_seasonal` to `lgbm_direct`") with expected impact and risk level.

### Executive Commentary (`POST /ai/commentary`)

Generates S&OP-ready executive summaries:

```json
{ "lob": "retail" }
```

Returns a 3-5 sentence summary, key metrics with trends, exceptions, and action items.

### Graceful Degradation

All AI features work without Claude — they fall back to template-based responses using the same data structures. The UI and downstream consumers don't need to handle a different schema.

---

## Planner Overrides

Demand planners can manually adjust forecasts through the override store.

```python
from src.overrides import OverrideStore

store = OverrideStore()

# Add an override
store.add_override(
    lob="retail",
    old_sku="PROD_A",
    new_sku="PROD_B",
    proportion=0.6,
    scenario="replacement",
    ramp_shape="linear"
)

# Retrieve overrides
overrides = store.get_overrides(lob="retail", week="2024-09-07")
```

The override store uses DuckDB by default, with automatic fallback to Parquet in environments where DuckDB is unavailable (e.g., Microsoft Fabric).

## Next.js Frontend

The same 8-page workflow is also available as a Next.js frontend at `forecasting-product/frontend/`. It connects to the FastAPI backend over REST and provides dark mode, responsive layout, and role-based navigation.

### Getting Started

```bash
# Start the FastAPI backend first
python forecasting-product/scripts/serve.py --port 8000

# In a separate terminal, start the frontend
cd forecasting-product/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local` to point to your API server (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`).

### Pages

| Page | Route | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Data Onboarding** | `/data-onboarding` | Upload CSV files, auto-classify columns, preview cleansing, generate config |
| **Series Explorer** | `/series-explorer` | SBC classification, structural break detection, cleansing audit, AI Q&A |
| **SKU Transitions** | `/sku-transitions` | New/discontinued SKU mapping, planner overrides, transition visualization |
| **Hierarchy Manager** | `/hierarchy` | Build hierarchy trees, aggregate, reconcile (MinT/OLS/WLS) |
| **Backtest Results** | `/backtest` | Model leaderboard, FVA cascade, champion map, calibration, SHAP |
| **Forecast Viewer** | `/forecast` | Fan charts, decomposition, AI natural language query, comparison, constraints |
| **Platform Health** | `/health` | Pipeline manifests, drift alerts, AI anomaly triage, audit log, cost tracking |
| **S&OP Meeting** | `/sop` | AI commentary, cross-run comparison, model governance, BI export |

### Authentication

The login page (`/login`) collects username and password, which are sent to `POST /auth/token` on the FastAPI backend. The API returns a JWT token stored in the browser session via NextAuth. All subsequent API calls include this token in the `Authorization` header. Role-based access controls which pages and actions are visible.

### Configuration

Key environment variables for `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000    # Backend API URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here             # Required for production
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000           # Frontend URL
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for production deployment instructions.
